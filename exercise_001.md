# Getting Started with Python: A Beginner's Exercise

Welcome to your first Python programming exercise! This guide will walk you through the basics of Python, covering fundamental concepts and giving you hands-on experience. By the end of this exercise, you'll have a solid understanding of Python basics and will have written your first Python program.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. **Python Installed**: Download and install Python from the official website [python.org](https://www.python.org/). Python 3.x is recommended.
2. **Code Editor**: Choose a code editor to write your Python code. Options include:
   - **Visual Studio Code**: [Download here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - **PyCharm**: [Download here](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)
   - **Sublime Text**: [Download here](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
3. **Basic Computer Skills**: Familiarity with basic computer operations and navigation.

## Steps

### 1. **Set Up Your Environment**

1. **Install Python**:
   - Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
   - Ensure the option to add Python to your PATH is checked during installation.

2. **Verify Python Installation**:
   - Open your command line or terminal.
   - Type `python --version` and press Enter. You should see the installed version of Python.
   - Optionally, you can use `python3 --version` if your system differentiates between Python 2 and 3.

### 2. **Write Your First Python Script**

1. **Open Your Code Editor**:
   - Launch the code editor you installed.

2. **Create a New File**:
   - In your editor, create a new file and name it `hello.py`.

3. **Write Code**:
   - In `hello.py`, type the following code:

     ```python
     # This is a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!"
     print("Hello, World!")
     ```

4. **Save Your File**:
   - Save the file with the `.py` extension.

### 3. **Run Your Python Script**

1. **Open Command Line or Terminal**:
   - Navigate to the directory where you saved `hello.py` using the `cd` command.

2. **Execute Your Script**:
   - Type `python hello.py` and press Enter. If your system uses `python3`, type `python3 hello.py` instead.
   - You should see `Hello, World!` printed to the screen.

### 4. **Explore Basic Python Concepts**

1. **Variables**:
   - Variables are used to store data. For example:

     ```python
     name = "Alice"
     age = 30
     print(name)
     print(age)
     ```

2. **Data Types**:
   - Python supports various data types, including integers, floats, strings, and lists. Try experimenting with these:

     ```python
     number = 10          # Integer
     pi = 3.14            # Float
     greeting = "Hello!" # String
     numbers_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # List

     print(number, pi, greeting)
     print(numbers_list)
     ```

3. **Functions**:
   - Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task. Define a function and call it:

     ```python
     def greet(name):
         return f"Hello, {name}!"

     print(greet("Bob"))
     ```

4. **Control Flow**:
   - Use `if` statements to control the flow of your program:

     ```python
     age = 18
     if age >= 18:
         print("You are an adult.")
     else:
         print("You are a minor.")
     ```

### 5. **Practice and Experiment**

- Try modifying the code snippets provided to see how changes affect the output.
- Explore more Python concepts such as loops, error handling, and file operations.

## Conclusion

Congratulations on completing your first Python exercise! Youâ€™ve learned the basics of Python programming and written a simple script. Keep practicing and exploring more features of Python to build your programming skills.

Happy coding!
