# Beginner Python Exercise: Getting Started with Basics

Welcome to your first Python exercise! This is a great opportunity to dive into the world of programming with Python. In this exercise, you will learn how to use basic Python features, including variables, data types, and user input. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

Before starting this exercise, you should have:

1. **Python Installed**: Ensure Python is installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **A Text Editor**: Use any text editor you prefer, such as VSCode, Sublime Text, or even Notepad.
3. **Basic Computer Skills**: Ability to navigate folders and run programs.

## Exercise Overview

In this exercise, you will:

1. Write a Python script that takes user input.
2. Perform some basic operations on the input.
3. Display the results to the user.

## Steps

1. **Create a New Python File**

   Open your text editor and create a new file named `first_program.py`.

2. **Write Your Script**

   Copy and paste the following Python code into `first_program.py`:

   ```python
   # A simple Python program to greet the user

   # Ask for the user's name
   name = input("What is your name? ")

   # Ask for the user's age
   age = input("How old are you? ")

   # Display a greeting message
   print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")
   ```

3. **Save Your File**

   Save your changes in the text editor.

4. **Run Your Script**

   Open your command line or terminal. Navigate to the directory where you saved `first_program.py`. Run the script by typing:

   ```bash
   python first_program.py
   ```

   Follow the prompts to enter your name and age. The script will greet you with a message that includes the information you provided.

5. **Modify and Experiment**

   Feel free to modify the script to experiment with different messages or questions. For example, try asking for the user's favorite color or hobby and display it in the output.

## What You've Learned

- **Variables**: Storing and using data (name and age).
- **Data Types**: Understanding how user input is treated as strings.
- **User Input**: Using the `input()` function to get information from the user.
- **Output**: Displaying information using the `print()` function.

## Next Steps

As you become more comfortable with Python, you can explore more advanced topics such as loops, conditionals, and functions. Keep practicing and experimenting to enhance your skills!
